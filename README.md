# Description

We used R to work on this project. All the codes were written and executed in RStudio. The "Data Files" folder contains the datasets we used for this project. Specifically, 
"default_of_credit_card_clients.xls" is the original data file we got. After the cleaning and preprocessing steps, "default_train.csv" and "default_valid.csv" are the training 
set and validation set we used to build our models.

The "Project Code" folder includes the codes we completed for this project. We divided our codes into separate R files by different model types. The "app.R" file contains the 
code we used to create our Shiny App. That app can demonstrate the parameter tuning process for some of our models.
